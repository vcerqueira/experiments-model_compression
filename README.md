# Model Compression for Forecasting

This repo is the supplementary material for the paper: `Cerqueira, V., Torgo, L., Soares, C., & Bifet, A. (2021). Model Compression for Dynamic Forecast Combination. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.01830.`

The files should be ran in the following order:


## 1-get-predictions.r 

This files gets the predictions from the forecasting models in each iteration of the repeated holdout procedure

## 2-combine-predictions.r

The predictions obtained in the previous point are combined using different dynamic approaches; these ensembles are also compressed into individual models

## 3-analysis.r

Analysis of the results obtained
